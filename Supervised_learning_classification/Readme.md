classification is used in this problem
Here's a step-by-step guide to solve a classification problem:

1. Data Preparation
   - Collect your dataset
   - Split it into training and testing sets
   - Perform data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables)
   - Feature scaling if needed

2. Choose a Classification Algorithm
   Common options include:
   - Logistic Regression
   - Decision Trees
   - Random Forest
   - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
   - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
   - Neural Networks

3. Sample Code Example (using scikit-learn):
